# Neural Conversation Models

Open-sources of neural conversation models

## Environment
We've tested the code in this environment

- Python 3.7.3
- PyTorch 1.1.0

## Implemented conversation models
- HRED ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04808))
- Speaker-Addressee model ([paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/papers/P/P16/P16-1094/))

## How to run the code
Please see the slides in XAI Workshop in slides folder.
